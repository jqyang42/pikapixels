      <h1> Racial Disparity in COVID Test Sites </h1>
      <h4>
        Access to testing sites is step zero and must be taken to begin COVID response and treatment. Therefore, it is an essential resource that should be equally as accessible for all communities. However, in some counties of large ethnically Hispanic communities, this is not the case in that, there are often-times fewer testing sites in counties of similar sizes but with larger Hispanic population densities.
        These analyses act as a foundation for further research such as going further into the distribution of test sites and minority groups within counties also, giving a more detailed view. There are also confounding variables to take into consideration such as COVID response budgets for each county and teh policies that each county has regarding COVID response. 
        Below is the comparison of Hispanic and Non-Hispanic population percentages and the number of testing sites in each NC county, which are grouped by total population size.

        Other than Onslow county, the counties with the next two highest numbers of testing sites have the lowest percentage of Hispanic people within their populations. With most of the large Hispanic communities in this group of counties having lesser access to testing sites compared to primarily white communities, this shows a disparity in access to COVID response resources.
